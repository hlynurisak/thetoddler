## Extras:
 - Image picker
   The user can pick a photo from their device library instead of inputing a link to an external image.
 - Color picker
   Instead of manually finding and writing a hex code for the desired color, we provided a more user friendly color picker in the create and edit list modal.

## Testing environment
 - This app has primarily been tested using the Expo Go app
 - Web view has been used to a lesser extent for testing

## Known limitations
 - An issue with the color picker library shows an error message upon saving a color when creating and editing a task. This has no observed effect on the app functionality outside the displayed error message in the Expo app
